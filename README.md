# Data-Processing
Matching textual columns of two dataframes

#Problem : Given are 2 datasets. 
#	   Dataset1 has 2 columns (unique_id1, text1)
#	   Dataset2 has 4 columns (unique_id2, text2, count)
#	   Match the values of text1 column with text2 column and from the result where match is >=90% extract the maximum value of count from most matching text2.
#	   The final output should have same coulmns as in Dataset1 with additional column of count (like unique_id1, text1, count) in same order.
